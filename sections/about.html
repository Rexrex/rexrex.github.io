                    <h3>
                        My name is  Manuel Guimar&atilde;es and I'm a Portuguese PhD Student at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instituto Superior Técnico</a> and a researcher at <a href="https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Group of AI for People and Society (GAIPS)</a>, <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">INESC-ID</a> in Lisbon, Portugal. <br>

                        Since I started as an Artificial Intelligence Researcher since 2016 I have delved into many different fields such as Human Computer Interaction, Intelligent Virtual Agents, Game Development, Mixed Reality and Machine Learning. Additionally I have been the Assistant Teacher for the <a href="https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/IAJ/2021-2022/1-semestre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artificial Intelligence in Games </a> for the past 4 years.

                        <br>

                        At the moment I am focused on finishing my Doctoral Thesis, which is about creating a framework that can facilitate the task of creating believable Social
                        Intelligent Agents through Data Driven Approach. My research interests are in artificial intelligence, virtual agents, affective computing, social interaction and their application in games.
                        <br>

                        During my PhD I have also contributed to the student community as an collaborator of <a href="https://labjogos.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laboratório de Jogos do IST</a> whose goal is to support the Game's student's community in IST by organizing events, talks and game's fairs.
                        <br />
                        In 2020 my colleagues and I founded <a href="https://gamedev.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Dev Técnico</a>: a portuguese student association focused on providing students at our university with the resources and mentorship required to develop their own games in an extracurricular and not for profit way. I have, since then, served as a member of its coordination. <br>
