    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
     Manuel Guimarães is a PhD Student at Instituto Superior Técnico and is currently working as a researcher at GAIPS, INESC-ID in Lisbon, Portugal.
     In 2016 I received finished my Master's Degree in Information Systems and Computer Engineering from the Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon in Portugal. His Master's Thesis was about empowering computer controlled characters with Social awareness and decision making. The end result was a mod for the popular video game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The mod quickly gained popularity and was widely talked about around the world.
     Immediately after finishing my Masters, Manuel started working in the RAGE Project as a researcher, since December 2016 until the end of the project, in January 2019, particularly, in the development of FAtiMA Toolkit. During that final year Manuel was awarded a PhD scholarship by Universidade de Lisboa to finish his thesis, the scholarship started in January 2019. 
     The scholarship allowed me to work on work on my thesis while consulting for on-going projects within the GAIPS group such as the Slice Project. In 2019, while working in Slice, Manuel also attended the 2nd International Summer School of Artificial Intelligence and Games, published several papers and taught Artificial Intelligence in Games practical lessons’ from September to January (semester) of 2019, 2020 and 2021. Finally for all his work during the year (2019) Manuel was nominated for best PhD student of INESC-ID.
     His research interests are in artificial intelligence, virtual agents, affective computing, social interaction and their application in games. Outside of research Manuel is interested in making games and has participated in (and won) several Game Jams. Additionally, he is one of the founders of Game Dev Técnico: a student’s group focused “on providing students at our university with the resources and mentorship required to develop their own games in an extracurricular and not for profit way.” 
     In his PhD Manuel has been creating a framework that can create help the authoring task of creating believable Social Intelligent Agents using a Data Driven Approach.
