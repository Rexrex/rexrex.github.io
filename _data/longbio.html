                I'm a PhD Student at Instituto Superior Técnico and I am currently working as a researcher at GAIPS, INESC-ID in Lisbon, Portugal. <br>

                In 2016 I received finished my Master's Degree in Information Systems and Computer Engineering
                from the Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon in Portugal. <br>

                My Master's Thesis was about empowering computer controlled characters with Social awareness and decision making.
                The end result was a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751622677">mod for </a> The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The mod quickly gained popularity and was widely talked about around the internet. <br>

                I started working in the Horizon 2020 <a href="https://www.gamecomponents.eu/page/home">Rage Project</a> as a researcher, since December 2016
                until the end of the project, in January 2019. My role in the project was to work specifically in the development of <a href="https://fatima-toolkit.eu/">FAtiMA-Toolkit</a>
                During that year I was awarded a PhD scholarship by Universidade de Lisboa to finish my PhD thesis,
                the scholarship started in January 2019. The scholarship allowed me to work on my thesis while consulting for on-goin g projects within the GAIPS research group such as the Slice Project.  <br>

                My research interests are in artificial intelligence, virtual agents, affective computing, social interaction
                and their application in games. Outside of research I started making video games and have participated in (and won) several Game Jams. <br>

                I am one of the founders and coordinators of <a href="https://gamedev.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">Game Dev Técnico</a>: a student’s group focused “on providind students at our university with the resources and mentorship required to develop their own games in an extracurricular and not for profit way.” <br>

                My PhD Thesis is about creating a framework that can create help the authoring task of creating believable Social
                Intelligent Agents using a Data Driven Approach.
