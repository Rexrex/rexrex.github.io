                <h2> Manuel Guimar&atilde;es</h2>
                <p>  I'm a PhD Student at Instituto Superior Técnico and I am currently working as a researcher at GAIPS, INESC-ID in Lisbon, Portugal. <br>
     
     In 2016 I received finished my Master's Degree in Information Systems and Computer Engineering 
     from the Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon in Portugal. <br>

     My Master's Thesis was about empowering computer controlled characters with Social awareness and decision making. 
     The end result was a mod for the popular video game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The mod quickly gained popularity 
     and was discussed around the internet. <br>
     
     Immediately after finishing my Masters, I started working in the RAGE Project as a researcher, since December 2016 
     until the end of the project, in January 2019, particularly, in the development of FAtiMA Toolkit. 
     During that year I was awarded a PhD scholarship by Universidade de Lisboa to finish my PhD thesis, 
     the scholarship started in January 2019. The scholarship allowed me to work on my thesis while consulting for on-goin g projects within the GAIPS research group such as the Slice Project.  <br>
     
     My research interests are in artificial intelligence, virtual agents, affective computing, social interaction
     and their application in games. Outside of research I started making video games and have participated in (and won) several Game Jams. <br>

     I am one of the founders and coordinators of <a href="https://gamedev.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/"">Game Dev Técnico</a>: a student’s group focused “on providind students at our university with the resources and mentorship required to develop their own games in an extracurricular and not for profit way.” <br>

     My PhD Thesis is about creating a framework that can create help the authoring task of creating believable Social
     Intelligent Agents using a Data Driven Approach. </p>
